# sequencer_text_plus
Add-on to a Blender sequencer (3.0->). (Changes text behavior in Text-strip) 

Adds three tools into Blender Sequencer.
  1. Typewriter effect in Text-strips.
  2. Flashing text in Text-strip.
  3. Scrolling text along screen.

Remarks:
  1) A diagonal text movement we get by combination of vertical and horizontal movements.
  2) Text movement respects a Wrap width, Crop borders and Box margin too.
  3) For non-standard font size - small manual correction
     in Graph editor is needed.
